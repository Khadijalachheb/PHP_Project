##Project description:

All the local administrative annexes(AALs) of Agadir contact the Wilaya of Souss-Massa to access the bases of
data recorded on the Wilaya's server, but this connection is not secure.
So,the IT department of the Wilaya decides to create dynamic DNS servers in
all the AALs and link them to the Wilaya server and manage the latter using a
Web application for connection management between the AALs and the wilaya to ensure security
of the connection.

##The web application should provide several functions such as:

✓ Authentication (limited and secure access)

✓ Access rights (two user profiles, i.e. administrator of the
Wilaya, or administrator of an AAL)

✓ Configuration of an AAL (add, edit, delete and display
information)

✓ Consult the logs of an AAL
(IP address, security keys (token), connection status and
date of last contact ...)

✓ Consultation of graphs:
 - connection graph of the AAL with the Wilaya.
 - graph of bandwidth in relation to people
connected in an AAL.

✓ Modification of the security key of the AAL (token) in case of risk.

✓ Update the database and configuration files
DNS server after each change of IP address and key
security of an AAL (token)
